# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project
A C project aimed at optimization and the use of appropriate data structures, as the program had to be tested with a randomly generated input file containing about 200 000 lines (each line representing a command). The goal was to execute all commands within a maximum time of 14 seconds and a maximum memory usage of 35MiB.
